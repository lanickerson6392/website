	  <h1> My Portfolio</h1>
          <p class="home">My name is Lynsi Nickerson.  I am currently a junior level student studying at Florida Gulf Coast University.
          I am pursuing a B.S. Degree in Software Engineering with a minor in Digital Media Design.  I aim to obtain this degree by the year 2020.
          My prefered future career is in the field of either computer applications software development or web development, but I am waiting until 
		I get further into my degree program to choose definitely.  I am
          very passionate about computers and computer software.  I have always been extremely interested in these things for as long 
          as I can remember.  I hope that I am able to join a career one day where I can truly pour out my love for computers and make life better
          for everyone through whatever I create.
