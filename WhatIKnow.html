  Computer science, software engineering, and information technology often sound like the same things.  Although these three subjects are very similar to each other, they all have distinct differences.  Computer science is a subject that involves a mountain of computer-related things, such as algorithms, programs, software, and even physical aspects of a computer.  Someone who studies computer science is considered a scientist.  Someone who studies software engineering, however, is an engineer.  This is really the biggest difference between computer science and software engineering.  Engineers have the goals of fixing problems, or making things more efficient.  Scientists are more concerned with how things work and expanding on the information that they have already learned.  While still similar, this difference is what sets the two apart from each other. Information technology is a little easier to contrast from the others.  Information technology is more focused on communication and networking.  IT professionals often communicate with clients much more than software engineers and computer scientists through troubleshooting help and planning.  Instead of specializing in developing new software, operating systems, or programs, Information technology is more focused on taking the existing technology and using it.
	Software engineering is a large field in computer science.  In simplest terms, software is what makes a computer actually work.  It’s what’s on the inside and the background, completing tasks and running programs.  Examples of software are Microsoft Word, ITunes, even the fun little apps on your smartphone.  Software engineers use computer science to create programs and algorithms that allow a computer to complete tasks in the most efficient way possible.  Software engineering is my favorite field of computer science, which is why I am getting a degree in it.  I love how software is in every computer and phone out there.  I also love the creative freedom you have with software engineering.  You can create software to do whatever you want, within the law of ethics of course.  It is just so interesting to learn about exactly what makes the computer do every task.
	Another field of computer science is hardware.  Computer hardware includes the physical parts of the computer, such as the CPU, motherboard, and the monitor.  These parts are all engineered very intentionally to do specific jobs within the computer.  Computer Hardware engineers use their knowledge of computer science to develop the best hardware to carry out certain tasks, whether that be for gaming, regular office work, or even something more complicated, like large servers for a corporate company. 
	Programming Language is also a field of Computer Science, and a very important one at that.  Programming languages are vital for a computer to be able to complete tasks.  Programming languages are basically “computer talk.”  It’s how programmers and engineers write code for the computer to understand.  If computers didn’t have programming language, it would be like a someone trying to communicate to a French person in Chinese.  Nothing would be carried out, and the computer wouldn’t work.
