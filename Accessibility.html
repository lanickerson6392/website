<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p> It is important to me that my website is easily accessible to as many people as possible.  Therefore, I have worked hard to design this website in such a way that people with any disabilities or impairments, and people on any device or browser, would be able to enjoy it.</p>
  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>I have included alternative text for all images on this website so that anyone who is visually impaired or using text-only browsers will be able to understand fully what is being displayed on the screen.</p>
  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <p>This website uses descriptive images as links, which also show up as alternative text if images aren't able to be seen.</p>
  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>All links open in the same window.<br />
    I have checked all of the links on this website an they all are working correctly.</p>
  <h2>Layout and Design</h2>
  <p>This website is layed out in a way where the navigation bar is always located in the left side of the screen, even when you scroll up and down.  This gives users accessibility to the navigation bar at any time they are on the website.</p>
  <h2>Text Size</h2>
  <p>The text size I used on this website can be resized to fit anyone's needs by using the browser's font-size tool.</p>
